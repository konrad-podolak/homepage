                you smoe words about myslef.
                I've just starded learning coding and I know that will consume a lot of time to became good developer
                but anything is easy and in this period you can create
                the world whot is very excited. I also love sport. I try to train Box and general strength training I've
                expirienced in this bacuse in my childhood i was practicing a lot of sports for example:
                table tennis, uni-hockey, athletic and football. With the last sport I had stayed the longest. But I
                wasn't sufficiently good especially in phisical strenght, so I decided to left sport for same time.
                After few years of break, sport starded be fun for my and that changed my life. But this
                website is about my IT cariera so in the bootom I recive some reasons why I want to became Web
                developer.
